#  Terminal Executor

This is an example SwiftUI app that can be used to execute a terminal command.
If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to interface with an application that doesn't have any sort of API, this could be a useful mechanism.

## App Sandbox

The first thing you have to do when creating a project that executes terminal commands is delete the App Sandbox.
Go to the project settings -> signing & capability and click the trash can to the right of App Sandbox.
